Decisions)

    seeded lda hyperparameter tuning
        use those from gensim?
    
    prepare seeds
        hyperparameters for Word2Vec?
        or am I using PmiSvd?

    gensim format / doc-top-matrix extraction
        in lda/, or in ntr/?
        what about summarize doc-top-mat (will need to)


Scripts)

    from JSON -> tabular

    grid search in seeded LDA
        iterating through alpha & beta
        coherence score(!)

    topic usage (detect topic in doc)

    keep track of post ID somefucking how.
        merge with original dataset after preprocessing?
        or keep adding ID while preprocessing?


Git repo)
    
    gitignore: models, data, except for test_data.txt


Documentation)
    
    First thing: run everything in master.ipynb
    
    At some point: run everything from terminal,
    where you can mess with the parameters in the script itself?
