Decisions)

    seeded lda hyperparameter tuning
        reasonable ranges?
    
    prepare seeds
        hyperparameters for Word2Vec?
        or am I using PmiSvd?

    coherence values
        look very different between ASM and SEED, despite both runing on gensim's CoherenceModel.
        What the hell?

    duplicates
        in case of duplicate posts, should they be removed?
        Probably no.


New scripts)

    push the JSON -> tabular part

    topic usage (detect topic in doc)
        https://jeriwieringa.com/2017/06/21/Calculating-and-Visualizing-Topic-Significance-over-Time-Part-1/
        1) normalize "topic weights" - topic probablities assigned to one document have a sum of 1
        2) aggregate topic weights over a time window
        3) 

    final time series plot
        with ntr + topic usage

    batch/path variable
        won't work on windows.
        Wrap in os.path.join nicely.



Git repo)

    Readme
        install, use requirements.txt


Usage)
    
    First thing: run everything in master.ipynb
    
    At some point: run everything from terminal,
    where you can mess with the parameters in the script itself?
