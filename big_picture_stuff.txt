Decisions)
    
    prepare seeds
        implement PmiSvd properly?

    duplicates
        in case of duplicate posts, should they be removed?
        Probably no.


New scripts)

    push the JSON -> tabular transfromation in the first step

    Infomedia
        a) merge files
        b) preprocessing

    downsampling
        a) aggregate topic over a time window for topic usage
        b) doctop matrix after normalization and before NTR for model evolution
            b.1) possibly also after NTR

    final time series plot
        with ntr + topic usage

    batch/path variable
        won't work on windows.
        Wrap in os.path.join nicely.



Git repo)

    Readme
        install, use requirements.txt


Usage)
    
    First thing: run everything in master.ipynb
    
    At some point: run everything from terminal,
    where you can mess with the parameters in the script itself?
