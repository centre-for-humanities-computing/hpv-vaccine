Decisions)

    seeded lda hyperparameter tuning
        reasonable ranges?
    
    prepare seeds
        hyperparameters for Word2Vec?
        or am I using PmiSvd?

    doc-top-matrix
        extraction: move to lda/!
        summarize: rolling average?

    coherence values
        look very different between ASM and SEED, despite both runing on gensim's CoherenceModel.
        What the hell?


New scripts)

    from JSON -> tabular

    topic usage (detect topic in doc)

    parallel preprocessing
    
    02_master problem: circular dependencies?
        cannot import e.g. from src.general.utility import compile_report 


Git repo)

    Readme
        install, use requirements.txt


Usage)
    
    First thing: run everything in master.ipynb
    
    At some point: run everything from terminal,
    where you can mess with the parameters in the script itself?
