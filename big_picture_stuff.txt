Decisions)

    seeded lda hyperparameter tuning
        reasonable ranges?
    
    prepare seeds
        hyperparameters for Word2Vec?
        or am I using PmiSvd?

    gensim format
        own utility script

    doc-top-matrix
        extraction: move to lda/!
        summarize: rolling average?


New scripts)

    from JSON -> tabular

    topic usage (detect topic in doc)

    keep track of post ID
        assign ID to each document in preprocessing
        keep doc ID at hand in the other steps


Git repo)

    Readme
        install, use requirements.txt


Usage)
    
    First thing: run everything in master.ipynb
    
    At some point: run everything from terminal,
    where you can mess with the parameters in the script itself?
